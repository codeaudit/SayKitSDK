## General plan:
In this tutorial we'll walk through how to use some of the most important features of SayKit. In Part I we'll treat each feature in isolation, and in Part II we'll put them all together into a full app.

The tutorial workspace, `SayKitTutorials.xcworkspace`, contains two projects: `SayKit Requests and Recognizers` and `SayKit Conversation Topics`. The first project demonstrates the use of several standard voice requests and command recognizers, while the second provides an example of a simple Conversation Topic hierarchy. 

We begin with `SayKit Requests and Recognizers`. Open it up and play around as you follow along!
