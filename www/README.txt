Site is written in Markdown files designed for use with Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com), a tool that transforms .md files into .html.

To perform the transformation, Jekyll must be invoked at the command line. The output will be generated into the `_site` directory.

To install Jekyll (and the Markdown parser we use):
`> gem install jekyll redcarpet`

To build site:
`> jekyll build` (in this directory)
