 *  For example, if the registry has a registered block capable of acting on a "Call" command (representing a request to begin phone call), the block may only be able to respond if a "phoneNumber" parameters is provided with the command. If that is the case, a validator function can do this check up-front, allowing the registry to correctly inform callers that it is not able to handle these ill-formed commands.
