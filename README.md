# SayKitSDK
Framework for building voice enabled applications on iOS

# Getting Started
## 1. Get the SDK!
Download the SDK here: TODO
## 2. Setup a Project
// TODO - Step-by-step Xcode setup for a barebones single-view application.
## 3. Create a Voice Request
// TODO - Create a simple Raw String Request on mic tap. Respond with a random string within a user-defined array of strings (like a magic 8-ball, so the user has some kind of interaction). (Also regurgitate what it heard the user say? To show that we're actually recognizing speech...)
## 4. Next Steps
